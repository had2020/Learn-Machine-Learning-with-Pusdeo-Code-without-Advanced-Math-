# Learn Machine Learning with Pusdeo Code without Advanced Math
 Clear explanations, formulaic pseudocode, and diagrams to make machine learning math understandable for everyone.

 ### Author: Hadrian Lazic

 This project contains the final PDF version of my independently researched paper:
 **Formulaic Code for Machine Learning Accessibility.**

 The goal of this work is to make Machine Learning concepts more accessible, particularly for students and developers without a strong background in calculus.
 It emphasizes formulaic pseudocode, transparency, and visual explanations over dense traditional notation.
